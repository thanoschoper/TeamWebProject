          <h3>What is Global Warming?</h3>
          <p>   Global Warming (Climate Change) is the process of our planet heating up. Scientists have observed that the Earth has had an increase of 1 degrees Celsius or 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the industrial revolution. But most recently, in the last 40 years, there has been a rise of 0.18 degrees Celsius or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit per decade! In fact, 9 out of 10 of the warmest years recorded have happened in the past 20 years!</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What Causes Global Warming?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fossil Fuel Burning - Industrialized countries have been burning large amounts of fossil fuels such as oil and gas. The gasses are released into the atmosphere and trap heat from the sun, warming the Earth. This is known as the “Greenhouse Effect”.</li>
            <li>Farming - Cows and other animals release methane and with 1.5 billion cows on Earth, that's a lot.</li>
            <li>Deforestation - Forests absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide which is another “Greenhouse Gas” and release oxygen back into the atmosphere. Sadly, many rainforests are being cut down which is not helping.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>What Effects Does This Have on Life on Planet Earth?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Glaciers Melting - Many glaciers are already melting and shrinking throughout the planet and will continue to if global warming isnt stopped</li>
            <li>Rising Ocean Levels - As glaciers melt, the oceans will rise, causing floods</li>
            <li>Animal Migration - Animals will migrate to cooler spots on the planet if their habitats get too warm. This could disrupt the food chain and put many animals in danger of extinction</li>
            <li>Extreme Weather - Some scientists believe that global warming will cause more powerful hurricanes, as well as an increase in droughts and flooding</li>
            <li>Change in Ecosystems - Colder biomes such as the tundra will shrink while desserts will expand</li>
            <li>Death and Poverty - Scientists believe climate change could lead to the deaths of 250,000 people and force 100 million into poverty by 2030</li>
            <li>Increase of Allergies, Asthma, and Outbreaks - They will become more common due to the increase of ragweed and higher levels of air pollution, along with favorable conditions for pathogens and mosquitos</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>What Can YOU Do to Stop it?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce and reuse materials</li>
            <li>Wear warm sweaters instead of turning up the heat</li>
            <li>Open up windows or turn on the fan instead of blasting the air conditioner</li>
            <li>Use powerstrips for lamps and TVs</li>
            <li>Air dry clothes</li>
            <li>Walk or bike instead of drive</li>
            <li>Voice climate-friendly support</li>
            <li>Turn off electrical devices when not in use</li>
          </ul>
